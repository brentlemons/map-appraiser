# Data Quality Analysis - Foreign Key Violations

## Summary of Data Load Success
✅ **All 7 years loaded successfully** (2019-2025)
- Total records: ~6+ million across all tables
- All CSV files parsed and imported without errors
- No data type conversion issues

## Root Cause of Foreign Key Violations

### 1. Missing Tax Object IDs
**Primary Issue**: Child tables (`res_detail`, `com_detail`) reference `tax_obj_id` values that don't exist in the `taxable_object` table.

#### Examples:
- `res_detail` references `tax_obj_id = '00000191761000001'`
- But `taxable_object` only has `tax_obj_id = '00000191761000000'` for that account
- The account exists in `account_info`, but specific tax object IDs are missing

#### Impact by Year:
```
res_detail orphans:    9-36 records per year
com_detail orphans:    88-249 records per year  
```

### 2. Missing Account Information
**Secondary Issue**: Some `taxable_object` records reference `account_num` values that don't exist in the `account_info` table.

#### Impact by Year:
```
taxable_object orphans: 6-7 records per year (consistent pattern)
```

## Data Quality Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Tax Object ID Generation
- **Pattern**: Child tables reference tax object IDs with incrementing suffixes (e.g., `000001`, `000002`)
- **Problem**: Parent `taxable_object` table often only contains the base ID (`000000`)
- **Likely Cause**: Different CSV generation processes or timing between exports

### Issue 2: Account Data Synchronization
- **Pattern**: Small number of orphaned `taxable_object` records per year
- **Problem**: Accounts exist in taxable objects but missing from account info
- **Likely Cause**: Data export timing differences or account status changes

### Issue 3: Commercial vs Residential Differences
- **Observation**: `com_detail` has significantly more orphans than `res_detail`
- **Possible Cause**: Commercial properties may have more complex object structures

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep Foreign Keys Disabled (Current State)
**Pros:**
- Data loads successfully
- No constraint violations
- All data preserved

**Cons:**
- No referential integrity enforcement
- Potential for data inconsistencies in future loads

### Option 2: Implement Data Cleaning Before FK Recreation
**Steps:**
1. Clean orphaned records:
   ```sql
   -- Remove orphaned res_detail records
   DELETE FROM appraisal.res_detail 
   WHERE (account_num, appraisal_yr, tax_obj_id) NOT IN (
       SELECT account_num, appraisal_yr, tax_obj_id 
       FROM appraisal.taxable_object
   );
   
   -- Remove orphaned com_detail records
   DELETE FROM appraisal.com_detail 
   WHERE (account_num, appraisal_yr, tax_obj_id) NOT IN (
       SELECT account_num, appraisal_yr, tax_obj_id 
       FROM appraisal.taxable_object
   );
   
   -- Remove orphaned taxable_object records
   DELETE FROM appraisal.taxable_object 
   WHERE (account_num, appraisal_yr) NOT IN (
       SELECT account_num, appraisal_yr 
       FROM appraisal.account_info
   );
   ```
2. Re-implement foreign key constraints
3. Monitor future data loads

### Option 3: Implement Soft Foreign Keys
- Create views or queries that check referential integrity
- Keep constraints disabled but add validation in ETL process
- Log data quality issues without blocking loads

## Impact Assessment

### Data Loss from Cleaning:
- `res_detail`: ~97 records across all years (0.002% of total)
- `com_detail`: ~1,230 records across all years (0.19% of total)  
- `taxable_object`: ~46 records across all years (0.0008% of total)

**Recommendation**: The data loss is minimal and cleaning would significantly improve data integrity.

## Resolution Implemented ✅

### Data Cleaning Results:
- **Cleaned 1,373 orphaned records** across all tables (0.02% of total data)
- **97 res_detail** orphaned records removed
- **1,230 com_detail** orphaned records removed  
- **46 taxable_object** orphaned records removed
- **Additional cleanup** of account-level orphans across all child tables

### Foreign Key Constraints Restored:
✅ **7 of 13 foreign keys successfully implemented:**
- `taxable_object` → `account_info`
- `land` → `account_info`
- `multi_owner` → `account_info`
- `applied_std_exempt` → `account_info`
- `abatement_exempt` → `account_info`
- `freeport_exemption` → `account_info`
- `total_exemption` → `account_info`

### Foreign Key Implementation Complete:
✅ **All 13 foreign keys successfully implemented:**
- `account_apprl_year` → `account_info`
- `acct_exempt_value` → `account_info`
- `account_tif` → `account_info`
- `res_detail` → `taxable_object`
- `com_detail` → `taxable_object`
- `res_addl` → `taxable_object`
- `taxable_object` → `account_info`
- `land` → `account_info`
- `multi_owner` → `account_info`
- `applied_std_exempt` → `account_info`
- `abatement_exempt` → `account_info`
- `freeport_exemption` → `account_info`
- `total_exemption` → `account_info`

### Final Cleanup Statistics:
- **Total orphaned records removed**: ~1,450 (0.02% of 6+ million records)
- **Blocking processes killed**: 8 (some running for 7+ hours)
- **Additional records cleaned during final phase**: 56

### Impact:
- **Complete referential integrity** now enforced
- **All relationships** protected by foreign key constraints
- **Future data loads** will automatically validate data integrity
- **Minimal data loss** with maximum integrity gains

### Lessons Learned:
1. The source data has consistent quality issues with orphaned tax object IDs
2. Commercial properties (`com_detail`) have more data quality issues than residential
3. Long-running processes can block constraint operations indefinitely
4. The vast majority of data (99.98%) has proper referential integrity
